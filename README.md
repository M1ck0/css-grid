# CSS Grid

## Intro

CSS Grid is lightweight grid, not a `CSS` framework. You can't use this to style
your elements on page. You can use this if you want to create responsive layout
for your content.
It uses CSS `grid` feature, hence the name of this package (if I can call it package).

## Why `grid` and not `flex`?

`Grid` is a really powerfull feature in CSS and it should be used for creating
page layouts because it take so much work of your back, especially when it
comes to responsive layouts.

If you need to support IE browsers then this package is not for you. `Grid` does
work in IE but with very limited support and not all features are available.
You can see support for `grid` on [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/?search=grid)

Content automatically scales, and all columns will be stacked,
one above another, when viewing on smaller devices.
